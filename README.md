## The Problem

The world is a diverse arena of millions of different cultures, customs and ideologies; these differences should be celebrated, however with these differences also come barriers to opportunity and progress. 

One of the ways in which the world has often broken down these differences and barriers is through personal relationships and networks. Some of the world's most successful leaders attribute their successes to their personal relationships and networks. For example alumni of Harvard University or McKinsey and Company regularly cite their alumni networks as the single most important outcome of their time with the college / company respectively. For example, when Harvard alums are moving to new countries, starting new roles or new businesses, one of the first steps is to reach out to other alumni for help or introductions.

For those individuals who do not have the benefit of exclusive alumni clubs and networks, accessing and navigating opportunities can be a challenge, or at best a lottery.

## The Solution

Movemeback seeks to better enable people to build their own ‘alumni communities’ by supporting individuals with common interests, goals and world-views to find each other and build real relationships. We believe one of the easiest and most meaningful ways this can be achieved is by connecting travellers. It is during times of travel that individuals are their most vulnerable, their most naive and in greatest need of ‘friends’ to help them to navigate, be that in recreation or business.

Therefore as a members community, we are building a service that enables users to share their travel plans with other members of the community and arrange to ‘connect’ during their travels. The motivations for the connection can range from social, local-knowledge or business.  We call this MMB Connect

## The Use Cases

**Use cases**

* Looking to connect for socialising

* Looking to connect for business help, guidance, introductions

* Looking to connect for local-knowledge and guidance

## The Requirements

**Sample Project Requirements**

* User can share their travel plans with other members of the community, specifying location and dates 

* Users can register (non-committal) interest in meeting with other members of the community

* Users can respond directly to the travel plans of other members to arrange to meet

* Users can comment on the travel plans of other members of the community and contribute ideas

* User will receive suggestions on who to meet based on common interests and location

* Users can share their location with the community on an ongoing basis

* Users can see who is in their location and reach out to meet

## The Task

The CEO of Movemeback needs your help to create a design and build a working code prototype of this new feature in 48 hours. It should be a working frontend prototype, however:

* You do not need to implement all requirements, however you should prioritise and try to implement as many as you can to demonstrate your understanding and capabilities

* It does not need to interface with a real backend, you can use dummy data, or even better build a dummy api service

* It does not need to be a fully-completed solution, although there should be enough to allow the CEO to demonstrate it to investors and important users 

* You will need to present your solution, share your vision, discuss your design and technical decisions and justify your choices

* You can request more time if you need - although in business you must always give a good reason and clear timescales for any extension
